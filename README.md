# 🐍💧🔫 Snake Water Gun Game (Python)

A fun **Python-based Snake Water Gun Game**, where you play against the computer.  
This repository includes **two versions** of the project — the original beginner version and an improved, optimized one.

---

## 🧩 Versions Overview

| Version | File Name | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| 🧱 **Version 1** | `version1_main.py` | The original version using direct `if-elif-else` logic for all conditions. Great for beginners learning conditionals and comparisons. |
| ⚙️ **Version 2 (Current)** | `version2_main.py` | Rewritten using numeric mapping and simplified logic for cleaner, shorter, and more efficient code. |

---

## 🚀 What's New in Version 2
- Introduced **numeric mapping**:
  - `1 → Snake`
  - `-1 → Water`
  - `0 → Gun`
- Reduced complex `if-else` chains to a **single mathematical comparison** 🎯  
- Improved readability and structure  
- Enhanced user experience with cleaner output

   ```bash
   python version2_main.py

2. Enter your choice:

3. The computer will randomly choose one, and the result will be displayed instantly.

🧠 Concepts Used

1. Conditionals (if, elif, else)
2. Random module (random.choice)
3. Dictionaries and data mapping
4. f-Strings for formatted output

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.8+
No external libraries needed (random is built-in)

💡 Future Improvements

1. Add multiple rounds and a scoring system 🧾
2. Display running score after each round
3. Include a replay or exit option
4. Possibly add emojis for fun interaction 🐍💧🔫
